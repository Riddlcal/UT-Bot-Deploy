# UT-Bot
A RAG chatbot for the University of Texas at Tyler - Capstone Project

We built a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot for the University of Texas at Tyler.

How does it work?

First we create embeddings of the text and place them into a vector database (like ChromaDB).

Then when a user asks a question, UT Bot finds the most relevant answer to the query and returns it.
