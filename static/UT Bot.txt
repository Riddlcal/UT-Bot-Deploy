Parents Q & A
How will my child get around campus?

Walking from class to class usually does not take more than 10 minutes, and the East Texas weather is usually mild.

Campus buildings, including residence facilities, are close together, which means students save time walking from building to building rather than driving.

Will my child be OK living in a residence facility?

Absolutely.

While we may not provide the exact same love and care (doing laundry, making beds) that he/she receives at home, we strive to be the next best thing. Whether it’s food, roommates, entertainment or supervision, the Residence Life Office has it covered.

Residence assistants are on staff at each housing facility to help students get accustomed to living on campus.

Where can students get advice?

While nothing can replace a phone call home, we do our best to meet students’ needs.

For general student life questions – orientation, student organizations, campus activities – students can contact the Department of Student Engagement Office.

While living in one of our residence facilities, students can always seek help from their Resident Assistant. RAs are upperclassmen who are assigned to a floor in each housing facility and offer support by mentoring, connecting them with the campus community and fostering relationships with and among the residents through planned activities.

When it comes to choosing classes or a career, students can always find help through Academic Advising and Career Services.

Our Student Counseling Center can help students work through such issues as time management and study skills.

Is UT Tyler safe?

We take the safety of each student entrusted to us very seriously.

UT Tyler has a highly-trained police department that patrols the campus around the clock. Officers routinely provide services such as vehicle jump-starts, unlock, and personal escorts for students leaving campus buildings after hours. Students can call the police dispatch to request an escort.

UT Tyler has a system for locking residence halls and using UT Tyler ID cards for re-entry. Students gain entry to their rooms using their student ID.

UT Tyler police are involved in crime prevention and awareness programs conducted throughout campus.

What if my child gets sick?

Your first thought will be to come take care of your child, but rest assured that the staff at the University Health Clinic, located on the campus, will help meet those medical needs.

A physician and nurse practitioner are available 5 days a week for primary care diagnosis and treatment.

The Wellness and Prevention Education Program provides counseling and educational information that help students make healthy choices.

What if my child has trouble with classes?

A quality education is what you’ve sent your child to UT Tyler to get, and that’s what we want to help ensure that they get. Our student success programs are designed to help students fully benefit from the university experience.

The Student Learning Communities Program groups students with other students who share majors and/or interests. They attend core classes together providing a supportive environment for academic achievement.

Supplemental Instruction provides peer mentors and tutors who help note-taking and test-taking skills.

Our Student Services Offices is extremely dedicated to helping students who have physical or learning disabilities through its Disability Support Services.

We want you to feel comfortable with UT Tyler, so we welcome your questions. Please submit them to enroll@uttyler.edu.

Academic Advising Frequently Asked Questions

How do I know who my Academic Advisor is?

Students are assigned an academic advisor within 24 hours of being admitted to UT Tyler.  Students can view their academic advisor at any time by logging into myUTTyler, clicking on the Academic Progress Tile, and then clicking on the View My Advisor tab on the left-side navigation menu.  

How do I schedule an appointment with my Academic Advisor?

Students can visit the EAB-Navigate platform to schedule an appointment with their academic advisor.  Once you have logged into the platform with your myUTTyler login and password you will be able to see your advisor's appointment availability and schedule the time that works best for you.  Students are encouraged to download the EAB-Navigate App on their smart-phone 

Where can I find my degree plan?

Students can view their degree plan, known as the Patriot Advisement Report (PAR), in myUTTyler at any time.  The PAR is considered your official degree plan at UT Tyler.  Check out the myUTTyler Advising Instructions page to find out how to view your PAR and how to read it.  If you think there is a mistake in your PAR, please contact your Academic Advisor and they will investigate.  

How long will it take me to graduate?

The time to graduation is unique for every student depending on your major and the coursework you may have already completed. Students are encouraged to use the Patriot Planner in myUTTYler which allows you to create a multi-semester/multi-year plan based on the courses you need to complete based on your specific major.  The Patriot Planner uses the Patriot Advisement Report (PAR) to determine which courses a you have left to complete and allows you to plan those courses in specific semesters which allows you to see how long completing your degree requirements will take.  Check out our myUTTyler Advising Instructions page to view our Accessing and Understanding Your Patriot Planner for more information about the Patriot Planner feature.

I have an Academic Advising hold on my myUTTYler account, what does that mean and how can I get it removed?

If you have an Academic Advising Hold on your account it means you need to talk with your academic advisor before you register for classes for the upcoming semester. 

If you are a returning student and know the classes you want to register for, please add the courses to your shopping cart and notify your advisor via email that would like to register for the courses in your shopping cart.  Your advisor will review your course selections and if they are appropriate, will remove your advising hold so you can complete your registration.  

If you do not know which classes to register for in the upcoming semester please visit the EAB-Navigate platform to schedule an appointment with your academic advisor.  Prior to your advising appointment please review your Patriot Advisement Report (PAR) to see which courses you have left to complete and make a list of potential course options you can discuss with your advisor.  

What is TSI? How do I know if I need to take it?

Unless a student is exempt, the Texas Success Initiative (TSI) requires all undergraduate students entering a public college or university in Texas to be assessed for readiness to enroll in freshman-level academic coursework. The Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board has only approved the TSI testing instrument to determine a student's readiness to enroll in college-level courses.

If you have questions regarding your TSI status, talk with a TSI Specialist.

Who do I contact for more information about some of the special programs such as CAP and Supplemental Instruction?

Supplemental Instruction information can be found on their website. CAP students will need to speak with their UT Tyler advisor assigned to them based on their intended major at UT Austin.  CAP students may also contact Veronica Viesca who serves as the CAP liaison with UT Austin.  

What does the four-digit course code on every course mean?

Example: ENGL 1301

The first digit indicates the level of the course.

(1 = Freshman, 2 = Sophomore, 3 = Junior, 4 = Senior, 5 = graduate)

The second digit indicates the credit hour value of the course.

(1 = 1-credit hour class, 3 = 3-credit hour class, 4 = 4-credit hour class)

The last two digits may indicate sequence.

(For example, students take ENGL 1301 prior to ENGL 1302.)

ENGL 1301 is a freshman level course worth three credit hours.  

How many hours do I need to take in order to be considered a full-time student?

A student who is enrolled in 12 or more credit hours is considered a full-time student; however, to stay on track for graduation and depending on dual credit, AP, or IB credits, you might be able to enroll in more credit hours. 

What is 15 to Finish or 30 in 3?

Most undergraduate degrees require 120 credit hours in order to graduate.  To ensure students stay on track for a four-year graduation it is important that students complete 30 credit hours every academic year.  Students can complete this 30 credit hours by either taking 15 credit hours every fall and spring semester, or by taking 12 credit hours every fall and spring semester and 6 credit hours over the summer for a total of 30 hours in three semesters (fall, spring, and summer).

How many classes should I take if I’m working a part-time job?

Of course, all students are different. However, most full-time students who work part-time find that taking 12 credit hours is the maximum course load they can successfully complete.

How long do classes last?

Classes which are held three days per week such as MWF (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) meet for 55 minutes each day.

Classes which are held two days per week such as TR (Tuesday, Thursday) meet for 1 hour, 20 minutes each day.

Classes which are held once a week, meet for 2 hours, 45 minutes.

Lab classes generally meet once a week for an extended period, for example, biology labs meet for 2 hours, 50 minutes, while Chemistry labs typically meet for 3 or 4 hours depending on the course.

Is it a good idea to schedule all my classes on the same day?

This sounds like a good idea – several days off per week, more free time, more hours to work, etc. However, this is probably not the best idea – especially not in your first semester. If you are like most students, you will probably not look at your homework on your days off. This leads to extra work on school days and more stress in the long run. Also, when test time rolls around, you will have all your exams on one or two days (more stress) rather than spread throughout the week.

What happens if one of the classes I need is closed when I meet with my advisor?

If this happens, you have two options. First, talk with your advisor to see if there is another course you can take instead. If there are no other suitable options, then you can contact the professor and department chair of the closed course to see if space can be made available for you.

I’m going to be participating in intercollegiate athletics. How do I know when to schedule classes so they don’t interfere with practice?

Before you meet with your advisor and attempt to register, talk with your coach to find out when practices and games are scheduled. Also, you may find it helpful to let your professors know that you are a student-athlete. This is especially important if you have to miss a class in order to participate in an athletic event.

I’m having trouble deciding between two majors. What can I do that might help me decide?

First, don’t let this stress you out. This is not uncommon. Many students are undecided or still deciding between two or more majors. UT Tyler Student Services offers an interest inventory assessment that can help students choose a career and the appropriate major for that career. You can contact them at 903.566.7079. You may also want to talk with an advisor in each of the departments in which you are interested. They may be able to answer questions and provide you with the additional information you need in order to make a decision.

How often should I contact my advisor throughout each semester?

As a general rule of thumb, students are encouraged to talk with their advisors on a monthly basis or at least twice a semester. This keeps you up-to-date on degree requirements and ensures you are on the right track for graduation. Feel free to visit with you advisor as often as you like.

Citations & Appeals
Why am I getting an error message when trying to submit payment for my citation?
99.9% of the time, the error message displayed after attempting to submit payment in the Parking Portal is due to an incorrect billing address. The billing address entered in the Card Information section must be the exact address that is on file with your bank or card issuer as a security measure. If your bank or card issuer does not have your current address on file, then your current address will cause the transaction to be denied. Please verify that the address you are entering for your card matches exactly with what your bank or card issuer has on file before resubmitting payment. If the issue persists, please email parking@uttyler.edu explaining that you have verified the address and it still isn’t working.

This committee is made up of 3 UTT students and 3 UTT employees (all outside of the police and parking departments). The Committee meets approximately once a month, and, according to university policy, their determination is final.

What do I do if I haven’t heard anything regarding my appeal?
Once you have submitted your appeal, the 10-business day timeline stops and there is no further action required on your part until the Appeals Committee has given you an email notice of their determination. The Committee meets about once a month, and they review every single appeal. If your appeal is granted, no further action will be required; if your appeal is denied, the citation will be upheld, and you will have 10-business days to pay the citation and avoid the onetime $10 late fee.

What causes vehicles to be booted or towed?
Any individual or vehicle that has accumulated three or more unpaid and un-appealed citations past the 10-business day timeline is subject to be booted or towed. Additionally, any individual or vehicle that has accumulated $200 or more in parking fines or possesses a lost, stolen, or altered parking permit is subject to be booted or towed.

How do I make sure my friends and family don’t get a citation when visiting?
All visitors to the UT Tyler campus are required to have a visitor parking permit. Non-affiliated guests, friends, and family can create an account through the Parking Portal, enter their vehicle information, and create a temporary parking permit for their visit, free of charge.


Parking Permits
How do I get a student permit?
First you must login to the UTT Parking Portal: https://uttylerparking.t2hosted.com/cmn/auth_ext.aspx. As a student, you will select ‘Affiliated Login’ and use your regular university credentials to access your parking account and order parking permits. Select ‘Get Permits’ and complete the steps that follow. You will be asked to select which type of permit you want (motorcycle or vehicle hangtag), provide your vehicle information, shipping address, and payment information. *Please note that the billing address entered during the payment information section must be the same address that is on file with your bank or card issuer for a successful transaction. You may, however, put any valid address you want as the shipping address for the permit to be mailed.

Do I need to put anything in my windshield while my permit is being shipped? I need to park right now!
You do not need to put anything in your windshield – not a receipt, not a temporary permit. You are covered immediately upon successfully ordering your new parking permit. By inputting your vehicle information into the Parking Portal, your vehicle is now covered in the system. The patrolling officers will run your license plate and see that you have a valid permit covering your vehicle regardless of whether it has arrived in the mail yet or not.

What is the difference between the blue student permit and the orange student permit?
The orange student permit is issued to those classified as student residents based on where they live. All student residents of on-campus housing complexes with their own private parking lots are issued the orange student resident permit and must follow the following university policy for resident student parking:

Student Resident permits have special designation to limit their parking to their resident lots Monday through Friday from 8 am to 5 pm. Students with these permits who park in other lots during these restricted times will be cited for Violation 103- Parking in area not designated by permit. After 5:00 pm, during the summer semesters and on all weekends, this restriction is not enforced due to ample parking on campus. (p. 11, Traffic, Parking and Safety Regulations)

How do I get an employee permit?
First you must login to the UTT Parking Portal: https://uttylerparking.t2hosted.com/cmn/auth_ext.aspx. As an employee, you will select ‘Affiliated Login’ and use your regular university credentials to access your parking account and order parking permits. Select ‘Get Permits’ and complete the steps that follow. You will be asked to select which type of permit you want (motorcycle, employee hangtag, or payroll deduction hangtag), provide your vehicle information, shipping address, and payment information if applicable. Many employees choose the payment option of payroll deduction because it is the only prorated option; if you leave your role with the university, your payments stop at that time and if you start working at the university in the middle of a fiscal year, you are not paying the full annual fee for a permit that expires in 6 months.

How do I get a visitor permit?
Family, friends, guest speakers, and all other non-affiliated external visitors of UT Tyler are welcome to a free UT Tyler Guest Parking Permit by creating a guest account in our Parking Portal here: https://uttylerparking.t2hosted.com/cmn/auth_ext.aspx and following the steps under ‘Get Permits’.

If you are a department administrative associate needing to issue multiple guest passes, please reach out to parking@uttyler.edu for further instructions and access to the UTT Web App portal.

If employment status ends at any point in the year, you will not be charged the remaining balance.

Is there anywhere I can park for free with no permit?
Yes, parallel parking along Varsity Drive does not require a UTT parking permit, because this is a city street. Varsity Drive is the street along the Northern perimeter of campus, running between University Pines and The Foundry Apartments.

Frequently Asked Questions
Do fraternities and sororities party all the time? What if I don’t drink or I’m not interested in that?


Most fraternities and sororities are values based organizations and promote positive aspects such as academics, community service, leadership, and lifelong connection. Although some fraternities and sororities have reputations for being big partiers, this is not always the reality. Don’t believe everything you see on MTV or in the movies. Fraternities and sororities are meant to enhance your academic experience as a college student, not detract from it. Also, all Greek-letter organizations have policies that prohibit underage members from drinking.


Do fraternities and sororities haze?


Hazing is illegal in the State of Texas and is a violation of the code of conduct at The University of Texas at Tyler. All fraternities and sororities have anti-hazing policies, too. Students seeking membership in Greek-letter organizations should never be asked to engage in any behavior nor do anything that makes them feel uncomfortable. This is considered hazing and will not be tolerated. If at any time you feel as though you are being hazed, please contact the Office of Engagement or the VP of Student Affairs. For additional hazing information, follow this link and scroll to the bottom of the page.


How do I go about joining a fraternity or sorority?


If you are interested in learning more about fraternity and sorority life or are interested in joining a group, check out our how to join page. Some chapters participate in "formal"/ "primary"/ "structured" recruitment, which is a process of mutual selection between current members and potential new members (PNM's) or candidates. You can also continue to check this website from time-to-time for more details, as many of the groups will continue to accept members throughout the school year.

Other chapters participate in an intake process, which begins with a formal informational session or formal rush where prospective members can learn about the organization, policies and expectations related to the intake process, and what they need to do in order to apply. From here, applications are usually submitted and then selected candidates will participate in educational meetings over the course of a few weeks. 

What are the grade and/or enrollment requirements to join a fraternity or sorority?

Individual fraternities and sororities do have a specific grade point average and credit hour requirements to join their organizations, so please check the Sorority Recruitment and Fraternity Recruitment websites for more information.


How much does it cost to join a fraternity or sorority?


Costs to join a fraternity or sorority vary from organization to organization. Typically, the fees the first semester a student joins are higher than subsequent semesters. Most fraternities and sororities have payment plans, and many members have part-time jobs on and off campus in order to help them pay their dues. You do not have to be rich to be Greek! It can be expensive to operate a Greek organization, and dues go toward national fees, service projects, social events, and other resources for members.


Do I have to live in the fraternity or sorority house if I join?


Currently, The University of Texas at Tyler does not have any type sorority or fraternity housing. 

Frequently Asked Questions
Supplemental Instruction
What is SI?

Supplemental Instruction (SI) is:
A series of weekly peer-assisted study sessions (led by an SI Leader) in courses identified as difficult by previous students.

Designed to help improve study skills with the goal of improving grades ½ to 1 whole grade point.

Voluntary for students who want to improve understanding of course material and content.

A collaborative effort among classmates to . . .

Compare notes;
Discuss important concepts;
Develop strategies to study the subject; and
Test yourselves before the instructor does. When they do test you, you’ll be ready!
What's an SI Leader?

Have you ever said, If I knew then what I know now? Or have you ever wished for a do over—repeating an experience from the past with the advantage of being armed with the information you have now?

These are impossible situations, but you can come close in SI with an SI Leader who:

Has taken the course before and done well.
Is a student and is prepared to share with you what to learn and how to learn in the course.
Will attend class everyday, hearing what you hear and reading what you read.

When do SI sessions start?

SI sessions should begin no later than the second week of classes. SI Leaders will hold one to two sessions per week depending on their availability.

What's in it for me?

With regular attendance, chances are good that you'll earn a better grade! You'll have developed a better understanding of course content as well as more effective ways of studying. This will help you in all your classes!
What can be expected in an SI session?
SI Leader will enforce main concepts from the lecture, share problem-solving techniques, provide test reviews, and give practice tests/quizzes before the actual test.
You can attend as many sessions as you like. Each session will be different as they follow the instructor’s lectures.

Sessions are informal—just bring your notes, textbooks, and questions.

SI is NOT:

Remedial
Re-lecturing
Copies of the notes
What if my course is not supported by SI?

If there is a course that you would like to be supported by SI in the future, there are three steps to take:

1. Check to see if your course is supported by any other academic programs on campus, such as the PASS Tutoring Center, Math Learning Center, Writing Center, or Upswing.

2. Talk with your instructor! Share with your instructor that you feel SI would be beneficial to your academic experience in their course. Encourage your faculty member to contact the SI Program Coordinator to discuss support options.

3. Contact the SI Program Coordinator at supplementalinstruct@uttyler.edu. Please send an email that includes information about the course you are requesting and a brief explanation of why you feel SI support would be beneficial for that course. 

HOW IS SI DIFFERENT? 

Supplemental Instruction (SI) is a non-remedial academic support program that focuses on collaboration, group study, and student to student interaction to support students in one specific course the entire semester. The goal of SI Leaders is to facilitate a collaborative learning environment through group work and interactive activities that reinforce concepts students learned with the professors. The SI sessions are voluntary, and they are regularly scheduled outside of class. 

 	Supplemental Instruction (SI)	Tutoring 
What is it? 	Supplemental Instruction (SI) is a non-remedial academic support that focuses on collaboration, group study, and interaction to assist students in one specific course the entire semester. 	Tutoring- help students help themselves, or to assist/guide them to the point at which they become an independent learner, and thus no longer need a tutor. 
Who is it? 	SI Leaders are model students and are working towards a college degree like you. 
  
SI Leaders do not know all the answers, do not teach content (new or old), and will always refer students to instructors and other resources. SI Leaders are peers and can relate to students on their level of learning because they are also students. They have taken the class before and have done well. 	Student Tutors are model students and are working towards a college degree like you. 
 
Tutors do not know all the answers, do not teach content (new or old), and will also refer students to instructors and other resources. 
How does it work? 	SI Leaders encourage group participation and collaborative learning. They review material students have already learned in classes and labs and use collaborative learning techniques to get the students working together to retain information. 	Tutors usually work one-on-one with students to review 1-2 concepts or questions. 
 
They engage in a dialogue so students can get clarity on specific questions or problems they are working on and come ready with questions for their tutor.
What is the relationship to the students they help? 	SI Leaders are peers and can relate to students on their level of learning because they are also students. They have taken the class before and have done well. 	Tutors are typically seen as peers and can relate to students on their level of learning. They have taken the classes they support and have done well in those classes. 
What is the overall goal? 	SI Leaders are oriented towards creating a collaborative learning environment through group work and engaging activities that reinforce concepts students learned with the professors. They break down concepts into smaller parts and emphasize cause and effect relationships.  	Tutors are oriented towards serving students’ immediate needs on particular questions. They equip students with skills so that they can answer their own questions without the help of a tutor.

ABOUT US
The PASS Tutoring Center is located in LIB 401 for face to face tutoring, and available through zoom for online tutoring. You do not need an appointment to see a tutor in person; however, you will need an appointment to work with a tutor online. For assistance scheduling an online appointment, please contact us at tutoring@uttyler.edu.

How Can We Help You? 
The PASS Tutoring Center has moved its UT Tyler student tutors to Zoom for online tutoring sessions. In order to make an online tutoring appointment with a UT Tyler student tutor, please visit Navigate. 

How to Make an Online Appointment with a UT Tyler Tutor via Navigate

We are still partnered with Upswing to offer free 24/7 online sessions with Upswing tutors, so feel free to continue this service whenever UTT tutors are unavailable. If you have any questions, please email us at tutoring@uttyler.edu.

The Patriot Academic Success Services (aka, PASS) Tutoring Center offers free, walk-in, face to face tutoring for our currently enrolled UT Tyler students. We also offer online tutoring through Zoom on an appointment basis. We offer tutoring on a variety of STEM, business, and nursing courses that many students take during their undergraduate career. Support for these courses are chosen based on historical institutional data, such as high failure rates, D grades, and withdrawal rates from these courses. 


All of our tutors are students as well. They have taken the course(s) they support, earned an A or B, and are faculty recommended. On top of these high qualifications, our tutors are rigorously trained throughout the semester to ensure that our students have the best experience while visiting the PASS Tutoring Center.  

What Can I Expect When I Visit the PASS Tutoring Center? 

We offer a challenge and support approach in the PASS Tutoring Center. Our tutors will challenge our students to think critically and learn independent learning skills in a collaborative learning environment.  

This means our tutors are not there to give you the answers or do your work for you. After all, our tutors cannot be in class with you when you take your exams. Instead, our tutors can guide you to find the answers on your own, share tips for studying and learning the content from their time taking the course, and help break down difficult content in a way that may be easier to understand.  

Our tutors often help students in a group setting, so they will float from student to student. They are sure to assist each student and answer their questions to the best of their abilities. You do not need to make an appointment to work with a tutor face to face; however, you will need to make an appointment to see a tutor online. In order to assist as many students as possible, we do not guarantee one on one time with our tutors even if you make an online appointment.
